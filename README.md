# enjoyreading-ng

This is a maintenance fork of the Enjoy Reading extension for Firefox.

The original version of Enjoy Reading was written by Jonathan Blanchet
<https://github.com/jblanche> and it was, in turn, a modification of the
Readability extension for Firefox, by Arc90 Labs.

It was imported into a git repository by Remigiusz Modrzejewski
<https://github.com/lrem> and is currently kept by Rog√©rio Brito
<https://github.com/rbrito>.

## Why this fork?

Unfortunately, the original Enjoy Reading extension wasn't updated to be
declared compatible with current Firefox versions (and Firefox has been
changing a lot with their new versioning scheme).

## Where is the original Enjoy Reading?

You can find the original Enjoy Reading extension at
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/enjoy-reading/>.

## User review

The only one that got through before AMO took down the add-on:

> I've had bad eyes my whole life and reading various sites can be tricky
> for me. I think I've tried every other spawn-of-Readability addon
> available, but this one is the absolute best. Thank you so much for
> keeping it alive! It is something I use easily a dozen times every day and
> it improves the quality of my online life more than I can even express
> with words.

## Note

This is not in AMO for *good* reasons.
Seems that it is impossible right now to submit readability-based add-on.
The reply is broken down in the issues page.
**None of the problems have been introduced in this fork**.
