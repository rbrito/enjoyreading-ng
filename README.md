# Superfluous extension

This extension is now superfluous, as new versions of Firefox/Iceweasel (and
other derived browsers) all support a reader mode that embeds the
readability mode that this extension used to provide.
    
For historical purposes, though, the old content is still on the `backup`
branch, if anybody wants to look at it.
